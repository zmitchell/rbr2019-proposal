# Rust Belt Rust 2019 Talk Proposal
I've only given a lightning talk before, so I've never had to come up with a talk proposal. You may be in the same boat. I'm going to write this in the open so that others can see what it looks like to write a proposal e.g. what questions you have to answer, etc. The git log should illustrate my process so that you can see how I refine my ideas over time.

Hopefully someone finds this educational!
