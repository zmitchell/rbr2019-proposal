# Notes
These are quotes from the articles above that I found enlightening. I'll distil them into something more useful in a different file.
- You only need to know enough to provide useful advice to other people who aren't as experienced as you are.
- Further, troubleshooting talks help attendees feel like they are not alone — everyone hits rough patches when working with new technologies.
- Your speaker bio is also critical to the acceptance process
- your bio is probably the only opportunity to demonstrate why they should select you to speak about a topic.
- conferences may ask for not disclosing names, employers or gender in the proposal itself amongst many other factors. Make certain you’ve understood what you’re being asked for.
- Create a scene that can be visualised, especially from an attendee point of view. Is there a theme? What will I learn?
- Focus on take-ways and leave out some unknowns, that organisers will want to see clarified.
- Direct the proposal to the attendees, not the curators
- Tell the reader why your talk will interest them, and what they will learn.
- Generally speaking, a shallow introduction to many things is not as interesting as an in-depth introduction to one thing.
- Often, talks answer questions that start with “how”, “why”, “when” and so on. An easy trick is to directly ask these questions in your proposal, leaving the reader wondering the answer.
- If your first draft requires more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your topic, edit to slim things down.
- Why is Angelina’s proposal compelling? It asks what practical applications a cool new technology can be used for “right now”, then offers to fill an existing knowledge gap, and show you examples of how to use the technology in your work.
- Why is Stuart’s proposal compelling? It claims you can do something unexpected (write and perform music with JavaScript), and says that after the talk, you will be able to do so yourself.
- Have your proposal reviewed by someone with experience
- Your goal in writing a proposal is to convince the reviewers that, as well as thinking about your idea, and how to present it, you’ve considered the people who will come to see your talk. 
- One sentence that describes the topic that you’ll be talking about, and one sentence that describes what the audience will take away from listening to your talk or participating in your workshop, is all you need.
- Make it clear to the reviewers that you know what you are talking about.
- That you have a plan to communicate what you know to the audience and you’ve thought about how to do this within the time limit of the speaking slot.
- Answer all the selection criteria for the conference.
- The reviewers want to feel comfortable that you have a plan.
- proposals with less detail loose out to proposals that provide more
- Don’t sell snow to Eskimos
- Step 1: Write down the general, high-level ideas that you want to talk about
- Step 2: Break your content into topic points
- spend a little time doing some fact-checking; tighten your points up a bit with real and concrete information.
- When you think about your presentation’s topic, what is the common point of pain that you believe you share with other people?
- After you’ve identified that common point of pain, what’s the general, high-level solution?
- Merely telling people that there is pain and a solution is great to lead with; however, it’s not enough. You’ll still need to convince people that this idea applies to a broad range of other contexts, and that this is a presentation that they need to see so that they can benefit from your wisdom.
- If you’re able to pull something personal into your proposal, you can help reviewers and audiences members further relate to you and what you’ve been through.
