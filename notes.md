    - Is it something they can relate to?
    - Is it a talk that you would want to attend?
    - Do you share a common pain point with the audience?
- In the abstract focus on takeaways, but leave some questions unanswered so that there is a reason to see the talk.
- A survey probably isn't as interesting as a deep-dive.

- Two paragraphs (or the limit imposed by the conference organizers) is a good limit for the abstract.
- If you're introducing a cool new technology, make sure you illustrate how it can be used right now.
- Can you explain to an attendee how they can do something unexpected?
- Try to convey to the reviewer that you've put thought into the proposal.
    - Is it evident that **you** know who your audience?
    - Is it evident that you've planned how to effectively package up the information you want to convey?
